So as a joke, I went to my friend's house wearing Pekora's
wig and clothes. I could barely stop my laughter as he went as red as a tomato
and looked at me from head to toe with a bit of drool in his mouth.
The way he stared made mde feel a bit funny too,
but I decided to tease him more by taking off my clothes.
He asked me, "Are you serious?" and I said "Yep peko."
